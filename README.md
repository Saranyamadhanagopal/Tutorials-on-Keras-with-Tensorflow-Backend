# What is Tensorflow?
- A software framework for building and deploying machine learning models.
- Tensorflow gives you the basic building blocks that you need to design,train and deploy machine learning models.
- Its typically used to build deep neural networks.
- Deep neural networks built with Tensorflow used in many different areas

   1. **Image recognition** - Where you recognize what object appear in a picture.
   2. **Speech recognition** - Where you turn speech into text.
   3. In particular course, well use Tensorflow to solve typical business problem of estimating sales.

- Tensorflow is a low level toolkit. It takes few lines of code to build machine learning model in Tensorflow. Because of this there are wrappers for tensorflow that simplify common operations. The most popular wrapper with tensorflow is keras.

- **keras** - High-level tensorflow wrapper for building neural networks with only a few lines of code. 



# Basic Questions:
1. What is a tensorflow session?
    An object that runs on the computation graph and tracks the state of each node in the graph.
2. The Google Cloud SDK is a set of command-line utilities that can be used to interactive with the Google Cloud service from your local computer.
True

# Installation:
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) Python 3.6 version.
- Download and install [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) Community edition.

- Install tensorflow on windows

Take the following steps to install TensorFlow in an Anaconda environment:



1. Create a conda environment named tensorflow by invoking the following command:

`C:> conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5 `

2. Activate the conda environment by issuing the following command:

`C:> activate tensorflow`
 `(tensorflow)C:>  # Your prompt should change `

3. Issue the appropriate command to install TensorFlow inside your conda environment. To install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:

`(tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow `

- To install the GPU version of TensorFlow, enter the following command (on a single line):

`(tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-gpu `
